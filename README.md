# Spring-MicroServicesPracticeApp
Created a very basic app to perform interaction between microservices.

## Here we have three microservices:
### 1. ProductSevice microservice (Will run on Port-5100)

### 2. CouponSevice microservice (Will run on Port-5200)
### 2. OrderSevice microservice (Will run on Port-5000)

<p>
   ** The ProductService and CouponService Microservices are being used by the OrderService Microservice and this connection is done via RestTemplate and Eureka Client By Netflix.
