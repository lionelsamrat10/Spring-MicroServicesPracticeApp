# Spring-MicroServicesPracticeApp
Created a very basic app to perform interaction between microservices.

## Here we have three microservices:
### 1. ProductSevice microservice
### 2. CouponSevice microservice
### 2. OrderSevice microservice

<p>
  The ProductService and CouponService Microservices are being used by the OrderService Microservice and this connection is done via RestTemplate and Eureka Client By Netflix
